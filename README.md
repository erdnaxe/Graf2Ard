Graf2Ard
========

This project is created by erdnaxe : [https://github.com/erdnaxe/Graf2Ard](https://github.com/erdnaxe/Graf2Ard).
You can make a fork and comment it to improve it.

I create this project to make an easier way to program the [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/).
It's base on the idee of NXT-g, the [NXT software](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms_NXT). So it's not a real grafcet.

Sorry but the project is in french. A translation will come...

## How to use ##
To fill the "objects" you want to put in your web app, just go to "assets/objects" and copy the exemple.
There are tree colors : orange, blue and yellow.

## Requirements for the host ##
* A web server: like "localhost" or a website.
* PHP: I develop this project with the last PHP (5.5).
* Folder listing disabled on the server (for crazy man...).

## Requirements for the client ##
* Javascript support with a recent browser (IE 8+, chrome, firefox...).

## List of the librairies used ##
* First of all : [JQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [JQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/).
* [JQuery UI touch punch](http://touchpunch.furf.com/) for touchscreen support.
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) (CSS and Javascript addons).
* [MouseTrap](http://craig.is/killing/mice) MouseTrap to cach keyboard shortcut.

## Directory system ##
* In "vendor": all librairies I didn't create like JQuery.
* In "assets": all the JS, JSON, CSS and img files.
* In "app": all the server code or content catch by the page.

I apologise for my dirty english: I'm french ^^.
